# capital-bike-demand-forecast
Analysis and forecast of the demand for bikes in the Capital bikesharing system. The dataset comes from the public dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset. 
The goal is to provide data-driven recommendation about how to develop a dynamic price strategy and manage the bikes' fleet better.
In this repository is possible to find:

1. a .R file that is the code of the analysis
2. a .pdf file that is a short summary of approach and insights of analysis
3. a .rmark file that is the complete analysis results, where it is discussed the final results and its strength and weaknesses.

Feel free to reach me with feedbacks and comments.
