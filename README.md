# capital-bike-demand-forecast
Analysis and forecast of the demand for bikes in the Capital bikesharing system. The dataset comes from the public dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset. 
The goal is to provide data-driven recommendation about how to develop a dynamic price strategy and manage the bikes' fleet better.
In this repository is possible to find:

1Ô∏è‚É£. a .R file that is the analysis' code
2Ô∏è‚É£. a .pdf file that is a short summary of the approach and insights coming from the study
3Ô∏è‚É£. a .md file that contains the full analysis, results, insights and reccomendations. It is rendered and ready-to-be-presented.
4Ô∏è‚É£. a .rmd file that contains the code for the Rmarkdown document displayed in the .md file. The difference is that, if knitted, this file produces a .html files and includes some interactive charts (that in the .md files were made as not-interactive). 
5Ô∏è‚É£. a folder that contains the plot/images included into the .md file.
